# Alec's Nix flake

This system flake contains desktop configurations for all my systems.

## Support

I'd advise you not to copy my system flake if you're just getting started with Nix. You should have a solid understanding of Nix before building.

That being said - if you need a helping hand with Nix, I'm always available to chat via Discord: `@amazinaxel`.
