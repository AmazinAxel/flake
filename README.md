# Alec's Nix flake

This system flake contains desktop configurations for all my systems.

## Warranty & support

If you're just getting started with Nix, I'd advise you to not copy my system flake. You should have a solid understanding of Nix and it's inner workings before building this flake. As always, make sure to modify `hardware-configuration.nix` with your system-specific configuration.

That being said - if you need help getting started with Nix, I'm always available to chat via Discord: `@amazinaxel`.

I am not liable if your system breaks for any reason.
